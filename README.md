# Quiz Game

This is my coding challenge submission for day #17 of the 100 Days of Code: The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp, instructor-led training.

This is application is a Trivia style quiz game. Questions are around a certain topic i.e. computer science and the user's final score is displayed at the end of the quiz.

What makes this quiz interesting is that it's written in OOP and the question data was imported from the Open Trivia Database. Meaning, that the database can be easily replaced by another topic of interest using the Open Trivia Database's API.
